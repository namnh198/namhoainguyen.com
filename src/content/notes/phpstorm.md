## Indexing Options

### Limit CPU Usage

By default, PHPStorm allows full CPU usage (100%). Therefore the CPU is overloaded

- For indexing only Go to: Help -> Edit Custom Properties

```shell frame="none"
caches.indexerThreadsCount=4
caches.scanningThreadsCount=4
```

- For all (Include Search Files,...) Go to: Help → Edit Custom VM Options

```shell frame="none"
-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=4
```

### Directories Exclude and Ignore Files

To improve performance, please exclude and ignore some directories and files that don’t use to scan & index (Such as log
file, symlink,…)

- **Directories exclude:** File → Setting → Directories → Select unused folder to exclude
- **Ignore files:** File → setting → Editor → File Types → Ignore Files and Folder → Add a new record **P/S**: If you
  have multiple project with the same platform. You can use shared indexes for these one **Go to:** File → Setting →
  Tools → Shared Indexes → Enable “Wait for shared indexes” (Updated: From Version PhpStorm 2023.3.1 it has been changed
  PHP Composer Packaged → Download Automatically)
