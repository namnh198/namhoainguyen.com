## Create boot Installer USB

- Download a full macOS installer from Apple
- Format USB to "MacOS Extended" (USB must be >= 32GB)
- Use terminal to create the bootable installer

```shell
# Sequoia
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sequoia.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

# Sonoma
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sonoma.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

# Ventura
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Ventura.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
```

## Keyboard & Trackpad Settings

Go to **Keyboard Settings** and then

1. Should choose "U.S" instead of "U.S. International" because with the later, we have underline score below special
   symbols like `"`
2. For Vietnamese Input method, **Don't** choose built-in VN input options. Use [OpenKey](https://open-key.org/) instead
   (Need to allow this app in _Privacy & Security_ if you don't want to turn off _Gate keeper_) because there have
   uncomfortable underline when we type and I have problem when typing in some apps like Messenger,...
   - The [OpenKey](https://open-key.org/) support auto switch input method smart: You're using Skype with `V` mode but
     when you switch to Terminal the input method will be automatically `E` mode
   - The [OpenKey](https://open-key.org/) support both **Telex** and **VNI** but I recommend you should use **VNI** to
     avoid conflicts when typing English in `V` mode such as `as => รก`, etc
3. Turn off "Use F1, F2 etc. keys as standard function keys" if you rarely uses them.
4. Key repeat rate -> Fast, Delay until repeat -> Short to skip delay when holding key

### Other useful keyboard tips

1. Enabled "Three finders to drag": \*\*System Settings -> Accessibility -> Pointer Control -> Trackpad Options"
2. Short switch new desktops: **Settings -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcut -> Missing Control** -> Checked all **"Switch
   to Desktop"**
