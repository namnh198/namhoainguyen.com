> [!info] Quick references DDEV to launch web development environments. View the
> [official docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more information.

## Why I used

- I loved DDEV because it simplifies the process of setting up local development environments. No need for manual
  installation and configurations of Webservers, databases and other dependencies.
- DDEV support various web frameworks and CMS such as Laravel, Magento, Wordpress,... Check
  [this link](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/) to view more.
- I can config workflow tailored to my specific projects need with extension and custom command.

## Some commands I usually use

> [!multi-column]

```bash
# intialize ddev
ddev config

# delete project
ddev ddev --omit-snapshot <project_id>

# list all projects
ddev list

# start ddev into project
ddev start

# stop ddev into project
ddev stop

# restart into project
ddev restart

# logs container
ddev log <services>

# list out ddev services per-project
ddev describe

# download add-on
ddev get <add_on>

# db gui
ddev sequeplace # launch Seq


```

## Configurations

- Overriding the default configurations `nginx` please removing `#ddev-generated` on file
  `.ddev/nginx/nginx_full/nginx-site.conf`. If not when running `ddev restart` it will revert to default DDEV
  configurations.
- `web_extra_daemon`: add extra daemons to startup automatically inside web container.

```yaml
web_extra_daemons:
  - name: 'http-1'
    command: 'PORT=3000 npm run dev'
    directory: /var/www/html
```

- `omit_containers`: List some containers should not be loaded automatically for one or more projects

```yaml
omit_containers: [db]
```

## NextJS Nginx Configurations

```html title=".ddev/nginx_full/nginx-site.conf"
server { listen 80; listen 443 ssl; ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/master.crt; ssl_certificate_key
/etc/ssl/certs/master.key; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header
Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade'; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_cache_bypass
$http_upgrade; } include /etc/nginx/monitoring.conf; error_log /dev/stdout info; access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
include /etc/nginx/common.d/*.conf; include /mnt/ddev_config/nginx/*.conf; }
```

## Communicate other project

Make the calls to projects B via the regular FQDN from project A

```shell
# call from project A inside container
curl https://projectb.ddev.site
```

```yaml title=".ddev/docker-compose.communicate.yaml"
services:
  web:
    external_links:
      - ddev-router:projectB.ddev.site
```

- Example (Fix CORS errors call /graphql Magento in Next.Js Project)

```html title=.ddev/nginx_full/nginx-site.conf ins={2-4}
... location /graphql { proxy_pass https://projectb.ddev.site/graphql } ...
```

## Performance Mode

- Mutagen

```bash
ddev mutagen reset # reset data
ddev config --global --performance-mode=none # disable for all projects
ddev config --performance-mode=none # disable for per-project
```

## PHPSTORM

- For easy setup PHPStorm, You can install `DDEV Integration` from
  [homepage](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18813-ddev-integration) or by searching the in-app marketplace
  (Preferences -> Plugins -> Marketplace) for "DDEV"
